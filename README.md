# Rock Run Rose's odyssey

Rock Run Rose's Odyssey is a 2D old-school platformer game. The game is
programmed in Rust and serves as an experiment with the Bevy framework.

It is aimed at children around 7 years old, with the objective of enhancing
reading skills through story following and mathematics (addition, subtraction,
doubling, etc.) for puzzle solving while playing.

All assets are under CC0 license, most of them coming from the repository

[https://github.com/BorisBoutillier/Kataster](https://github.com/BorisBoutillier/Kataster)
is a great example of using Bevy, and the game draws inspiration and uses
parts of the code from this repository.

The project is currently under heavy development, and it does not make
sense to provide binaries at this moment. However, as soon as the state
is sufficiently advanced, binaries and a playable online version will
be released.

## Run Locally (mainly for development purposes)

1. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/uggla/rock_run.git
```

2. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd rock_run
```

### Native

1. Install Rust following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr/learn/get-started).

   _Tips: the rustup method is the simplest one._

2. Install required library for macroquad

- Ubuntu system dependencies (to be verified)

```bash
apt install pkg-config libx11-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev
```

- Fedora system dependencies (to be verified)

```bash
dnf install libX11-devel libXi-devel mesa-libGL-devel alsa-lib-devel
```

- Windows and MacOS system

```
No dependencies are required for Windows or MacOS
```

3. Run

```bash
cargo rd

or

cargo rr  # for release mode
```

### Wasm32 client

1. Follow the above instruction of the native build.

2. Add the wasm32 compilation target

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

3. Run

```bash
cargo rwd

or

cargo rwr  # for release mode
```

## Known bug

1- Bad framerate and high cpu usage.

This can be due to a driver with incomplete Vulkan support as show below.

```bash
2024-06-16T14:30:01.931071Z  INFO bevy_winit::system: Creating new window "RockRun: Rose's Odyssey" (0v1)
2024-06-16T14:30:01.931597Z  INFO log: Guessed window scale factor: 1
MESA-INTEL: warning: Haswell Vulkan support is incomplete
2024-06-16T14:30:02.213994Z  INFO bevy_render::renderer: AdapterInfo { name: "llvmpipe (LLVM 18.1.6, 256 bits)", vendor: 65541, device: 0, device_type: Cpu, driver: "llvmpipe", driver_info: "Mesa 24.1.1 (LLVM 18.1.6)", backend: Vulkan }
```

This can be fixed by changing the backend from Vulkan to Gl using the following environment variable

```bash
export WGPU_BACKEND=gl
```

2- Menu UI is not rendered well.

TODO: insert a screenshot, create a environment variable to change the UI settings.
